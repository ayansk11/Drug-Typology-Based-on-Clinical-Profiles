# Drug-Typology-Based-on-Clinical-Profiles

## Multinomial Drug Classification Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This GitHub repository contains a detailed Jupyter notebook that showcases the application of several advanced machine learning models to classify drugs based on clinical profiles. The project evaluates Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Voting Ensemble model to determine which model provides the best performance across various metrics.

### Project Overview

The notebook conducts a thorough analysis, using:
- **Accuracy** to determine the overall effectiveness of each model.
- **Precision** to assess the correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall** to evaluate the models' ability to identify all relevant instances.
- **F1 Score** for balancing precision and recall, providing a single metric to compare model performance.

### Key Findings
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression** shows high accuracy and precision, making it ideal when false positives are a significant concern.
- **Random Forest** performs competitively but slightly lower in accuracy and precision compared to other models.
- **SVM and Voting Ensemble models** excel in recall, suggesting they are better at capturing the majority of relevant cases.
- The **Voting Ensemble** model demonstrates robustness with balanced metrics, making it suitable for applications requiring good performance across all evaluated parameters.

### Conclusion
The comparative analysis provides insights into selecting the appropriate model based on specific needs, whether it's high precision, recall, or a balance of both with the F1 Score. This project will benefit those involved in pharmaceuticals, healthcare analytics, and anyone interested in the practical applications of machine learning in classification scenarios.
